- Cost variance vs. estimates ($ and %)
- Number of completed plans
- On-time completion rate

### ✅ Production Efficiency Metrics
- Average completion time (days)
- On-time completion rate (%)
- Average production efficiency (%)
- Cost variance rate (%)

### ✅ Products Produced Analysis
Shows for each product:
- Total quantity produced
- Number of production runs
- Total production cost
- Average cost per unit
- **Current stock level** (stock relationship)
- **Stock value** (quantity × price)
- **Stock status** (low/normal indicator)

### ✅ Orders Fulfilled Tracking
Shows for each order:
- Order ID and customer name
- **Products produced for order** (order relationship)
- Fulfillment percentage with visual progress bar
- Total items vs fulfilled items
- Links to order details

### ✅ Stock Movement Analysis
Shows for each product:
- Quantity produced in period
- **Current stock level** (stock relationship)
- Minimum stock level
- **Stock coverage in days** (calculated metric)
- **Stock status** classification:
  - Out of Stock (0)
  - Critical (≤ 50% of minimum)
  - Low (≤ minimum)
  - Normal (> minimum)

### ✅ Low Stock Alerts
- Automatically detects products with low/critical stock
- Displays alert banner with count

- Quick identification of best sellers

### ✅ Recent Completed Plans
- Last 10 completed production plans
- Cost comparison (estimated vs actual)
- Quick view links

## Relationships Implemented

### 1. Production → Stock Relationship
```
Production Plan → Production Plan Items → Products → Current Stock
```

**How it works**:
- When production plan is completed, product stock is increased
- Dashboard shows current stock levels alongside production data
- Calculates stock value based on current quantity
- Identifies low stock situations

**Data shown**:
- Current stock quantity
- Stock status (critical/low/normal)
- Stock coverage days
- Stock value ($)

### 2. Production → Order Relationship
```
Production Plan Items → Order ID → Orders → Customers
```

**How it works**:
- Production plan items can be linked to orders via `order_id`
- Dashboard groups production by order
- Calculates fulfillment rate by comparing produced vs ordered quantities
- Shows which customer orders were fulfilled

**Data shown**:
- Order number and customer
- Items produced for order
- Fulfillment percentage
- Production plan used

### 3. Multi-Relationship Analysis

**Stock Coverage Calculation**:
```
Current Stock ÷ Average Daily Usage = Coverage Days
```
Uses `RawMaterialUsage` data to calculate average daily consumption

**Order Fulfillment Rate**:
```
(Fulfilled Items ÷ Total Order Items) × 100 = Fulfillment %
```
Compares `production_plan_items.actual_quantity` to `order_items.quantity`

**Cost Variance**:
```
(Actual Cost - Estimated Cost) ÷ Estimated Cost × 100 = Variance %
```
Tracks cost performance across all production

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries
Optimized with eager loading:
```php
ProductionPlan::with([
    'productionPlanItems.product',
    'productionPlanItems.order.customer',
    'productionPlanItems.order.items'
])
```

### Performance Considerations
- Uses collection methods for data grouping
- Eager loading prevents N+1 queries
- Calculations done in memory after fetching
- Date range filtering reduces dataset size

### Stock Status Logic
```php
private function getStockStatus($product)
{
    if ($product->quantity <= 0) return 'out_of_stock';
    if ($product->quantity <= $product->minimum_stock_level * 0.5) return 'critical';
    if ($product->quantity <= $product->minimum_stock_level) return 'low';
    return 'normal';
}
```

### Order Fulfillment Calculation
```php
foreach ($orderItems as $orderItem) {
    $produced = $productionItems
        ->where('product_id', $orderItem->product_id)
        ->sum('actual_quantity');
    
    if ($produced >= $orderItem->quantity) {
        $fulfilledCount++;
    }
}

$fulfillmentPercentage = ($fulfilledCount / $totalItems) * 100;
```

## User Interface Features
