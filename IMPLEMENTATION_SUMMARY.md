## 💾 Data Flow

### Recording Material Usage
```
1. User selects production plan
2. Chooses production plan item
3. Enters actual quantity produced
4. Records material usage:
   - Material selection
   - Quantity used
   - Waste quantity (optional)
   - Notes
5. System processes:
   ├─→ Creates RawMaterialUsage record
   ├─→ Updates RawMaterial stock (-quantity)
   ├─→ Updates Product stock (+quantity)
   ├─→ Calculates costs
   ├─→ Updates ProductionPlan costs
   └─→ Triggers alerts if needed
```

### Stock Alert Generation
```
1. System checks material stock after usage
2. Compares to minimum stock level:
   - If stock = 0 → Out of Stock alert
   - If stock ≤ 50% min → Critical alert
   - If stock ≤ min → Low Stock alert
3. Calculates days until stockout
4. Displays on dashboard
5. Provides reorder recommendations
```
