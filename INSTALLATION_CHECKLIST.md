### Existing Features Required
- [ ] Production Plans module exists
- [ ] Products module exists
- [ ] Orders module exists
- [ ] Raw Materials module exists
- [ ] User roles (admin, staff) configured

## 📦 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Files Exist
```bash
# Check controller
ls -la app/Http/Controllers/ProductionDashboardController.php

# Check view
ls -la resources/views/production-plans/dashboard.blade.php

# Check route
grep "production-dashboard" routes/web.php
```

- [ ] ProductionDashboardController.php exists
- [ ] dashboard.blade.php exists
- [ ] Route is registered in web.php

### Step 2: Verify Route Registration
```bash
# Check if route is properly registered
php artisan route:list | grep production-dashboard
```

Expected output:
```
GET|HEAD  production-dashboard  production-plans.dashboard  ProductionDashboardController@index
```

- [ ] Route appears in route list
- [ ] Route name is `production-plans.dashboard`
- [ ] Middleware includes `auth` and `role:admin,staff`

### Step 3: Clear Caches
```bash
# Clear all caches
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear

# Optional: Optimize if in production
php artisan optimize
```

- [ ] Route cache cleared
- [ ] View cache cleared
- [ ] Config cache cleared
- [ ] Application cache cleared

### Step 4: Verify Database Structure

Run these queries to verify tables:
```sql
-- Check production_plans table
DESCRIBE production_plans;

-- Check production_plan_items table
DESCRIBE production_plan_items;

-- Verify order_id column exists
SHOW COLUMNS FROM production_plan_items LIKE 'order_id';
```

- [ ] production_plans table exists
- [ ] production_plan_items table exists
- [ ] order_id column exists in production_plan_items
- [ ] products table has quantity and minimum_stock_level columns

### Step 5: Test Data Verification

Check if you have test data:
```sql
-- Count completed production plans
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM production_plans WHERE status = 'completed';

-- Check if any production items have order_id
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM production_plan_items WHERE order_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Check products with stock
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE quantity > 0;
```

- [ ] At least 1 completed production plan exists
- [ ] Some production items are linked to orders
- [ ] Products have stock data

### Step 7: Edge Case Testing

Test with edge cases:
- [ ] No completed production plans (should show "No data" message)

- [ ] Date range with no data
- [ ] Products with zero stock
- [ ] Orders with 0% fulfillment
- [ ] Large datasets (100+ production plans)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Route not found (404)
**Solutions**:

# Enable debug mode temporarily
# In .env: APP_DEBUG=true

# Check PHP error logs
tail -50 /var/log/php_errors.log
```

### Issue: Database errors

```

### Issue: Permission errors
