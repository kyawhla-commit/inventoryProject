# Production Dashboard Implementation

## 📋 Overview

A comprehensive production monitoring dashboard that integrates completed production plans with orders and stock management, providing real-time visibility into manufacturing operations.

## ✨ Features

### Core Capabilities
- ✅ Production summary statistics with cost variance analysis
- ✅ Real-time stock level monitoring and alerts
- ✅ Order fulfillment tracking with visual progress indicators
- ✅ Production efficiency metrics and KPIs
- ✅ Stock coverage forecasting
- ✅ Top-performing products analysis
- ✅ Cost variance tracking and reporting

### Key Relationships Implemented
1. **Production → Stock**: Automatic stock updates when production completes
2. **Production → Orders**: Track which orders were fulfilled through production
3. **Stock → Coverage**: Calculate days of stock remaining based on usage patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users
1. Navigate to Production Plans
2. Click "Dashboard" button
3. Select date range (defaults to last 30 days)
4. Review metrics and take action on alerts

### For Developers
```bash
# Route is already added to routes/web.php
Route::get('production-dashboard', [ProductionDashboardController::class, 'index'])
    ->name('production-plans.dashboard');

# Access the dashboard
/production-dashboard
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dashboard shows no data**
- Solution: Ensure production plans have status = 'completed'
- Check: Date range includes completion dates

**Orders not appearing**
- Solution: Verify order_id is set on production_plan_items
- Check: Orders exist and have items

**Stock coverage shows N/A**
- Solution: Need raw material usage history
- Check: RawMaterialUsage records exist for products

**Incorrect calculations**
- Solution: Verify actual_quantity is recorded on plan items
- Check: Data consistency in production_plan_items table
